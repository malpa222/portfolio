## Scrum board for the 3rd sprint (01.11-22.11)

### Sprint 2 retrospective

In the third sprint, I have focused on starting to work on my personal project and group project.

I started working on my personal project by researching about BitTorrent protocol and learning the basics of Go. It aligned well with my
research questsions which are about the use cases of Go and how it could benefit the BitTorrent protocol.

Our group managed to establish contact with Hoefnagels, a company located in Tilburg, to conduct a penetration test on their infrastructure.
The scope of the pen test was to test both physical and IT security while acting as an outsider threat. Morevoer, we had our attempts at spear phishing.

Morevoer, I have added a write-up on the phishing campaing for the group project to my hands-on experience. I had to work in Linux environment
and learn about phishing techniques.

### Explanation

In the next sprint I want to come back to the in-depth research and finish the write-up. Since the group project will be focused on the
reporting part, I will have more time to work on my hands-on experience.
