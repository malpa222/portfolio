## Scrum board for the 1st sprint (19.09 - 10.10)

I have decided to treat first three weeks of the semester as sprint 0, and start the first one on the 19th of September. I have decided to create epics for each
of the topics in the portfolio and assign issues to them.

### Explanation

In this sprint I am going to work on four epics: 

1. Trends research - Sketching the landscape of current red-teaming trends.

2. In-depth research - Writing a follow-up on one of the trends and its aspects. Starting with demo/PoC.

3. Group project - Project analysis and proposal. Because the contact with the company has been postponed, only in this sprint
our group is able to proceed.

4. Hands-on experience - researching Mitre ATT&CK techniques and learning them.
