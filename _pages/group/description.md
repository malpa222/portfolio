IT-Workz is a company which specializes in providing infrastructure solutions for educational institutions and other organizations which would
benefit from an outsourced IT solutions. They proposed an assignment - research how they could provide a penetration test as a service. The goal was
to find out about the current methodologies and techniques used in the red teaming field. Since IT-Workz wanted to introduce new product, we needed
to provide explanation on both technical and business levels.

Together with the project owner, we have decided that best way to tackle this assignment would be to conduct penetration tests on different companies,
which would give us a better overview on how a pen test is conducted and what are the requirements. Apart from that, we decided to research the current framework and methodologies used in the field.

## Hoefnagels

We started the research by establishing a plan of action. The first item on our agenda was to contact Hoefnagels - a fire safety company based in the
Tilburg area. In our initial meeting, we found out that the company does not have much IT experience, and that they outsource their infrastructure
to an external ICT company. Hoefnagels wanted us to perform a rather black-box pen test which would encompass physical intrusions, wireless testing,
social engineering and an black-box test of their infrastructure. The main focus was on the physical, wireless and social engineering tests; The external
testing however, was not the most important item in the scope.

### Planning and execution

As one of the first stages of the Initial Foothold cycle of the Unified Killchain was reconnaissance, we decided to refer to Mitre ATT&CK framework.
We have decided to use the common reconnaissance activities from ATT&CK to gain information about our victim and to discover entry points into their
infrastructure and other vulnerabilities. As IT-Workz wanted to receive information on how to conduct pen tests, we have researched and reported on
the most common pen testing tools. We used that research as an input for our reconnaissance phase, and combined it with ATT&CK framework.

Our initial research gave us the IP ranges of their web shop and the LinkedIn accounts of their employees. During the initial on-site research, our
team managed to get the IP address of the company itself, which was a great finding since we could use it to target any open services directly.

We have split the tasks among us and delegated each other to different areas. Together with Georgi Minchev, I chose to work on the social engineering
part - which meant that we had to conduct a phishing campaign. A write-up on my progress is available in the *[phishing](/group/phishing)* section of my portfolio.
