title: LO2 - The researcher and developer
---

The goal of this learning outcome is to show that I can work on a complex project with minimal guidance from the teachers, and be able
to show the outcomes of my research with the stakeholders and my peers. The research needs a clear goal and an approach that I will use
to achieve this goal. Then, by combining different and appropriate research strategies I need to be able to reach that goal and produce
a solution that can be verified by involved stakeholders.

## Group project at IT-Workz

My group project was an assignment at IT-Workz - a company that mainly on delivering IT infrastructure solutions to their clients (mainly
educational institutions). The company's expertize was in the defensive side of IT security. They strived to create secure and durable
systems and now they wanted to extend their field of expertize to penetration testing. That way, they could test already existing solutions
and provide accurate feedback of what and how should be fixed.

Therefore, IT-Workz tasked us with conducting a penetration test in an external company. They wanted us to use the results of the assessment
and knowledge from other sources to create a set of best practices, guidelines and procedures needed for penetration testing, reporting and
risk analysis. The desired deliverables were two documents: one for the management and one for the technical staff, that could be used as a
reference during future talks with clients and while executing pentests respectively.

### Goals and the scope

After the initial talks with the company, we have decided on the scope of the project: a pentest at an external company with a report,
two documents with procedures and guidelines for providing penetration tests as a service and a research (possibly with proof of concept)
on how to automate reporting of penetration tests.

The most important part for IT-Workz was to provide them with guidelines for penetration testing for their technical and management
personnel. The automated reporting was still a big point of interest, but they were mainly curious if that could be possible, and
did not expect a finished product from our team.

Having received the business requirements from the product owners, our group has proceeded to define the relevant research question and
its sub-questions, followed by establishing the required strategy (or more) to answer each of them.  However, the main research question
was: **How can IT-Workz ensure that a pentest can be provided as a service?**, with the sub-questions focusing on:

- What are the security needs of educational institutions?
- What are other companies offering and how can IT-Workz compete with that?
- What are the required skills and tooling for pentesting?
- What should a pentest report contain and can the process be automated?

You can find more about the research questions in my
[group project research description](https://malpa222.github.io/portfolio/group/description#research-questions).
