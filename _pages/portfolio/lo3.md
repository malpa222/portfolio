title: LO3 - The security professional
---

The goal of this learning outcome is to prove that I have worked on and improved my security specialist as well as
research and development skills. Moreover I have to show that I have applied aforementioned qualities in a professional
setting and were able to independently work on delivering good and valuable products.

## Research skills

[comment]: # - Where did you define and use a research approach? (group project, individual project,
[comment]: # professional application as a security specialist). For these projects explain:
[comment]: # - From your main question(s) and sub-questions how did you consider the different
[comment]: # research strategies? What strategies where used and why these?
[comment]: # - Triangulation and value:
[comment]: # - What were the research results from the combined research strategies?
[comment]: # - What was the value for the client of your R&D? What now does he have or know?
[comment]: # - How can and/or should this R&D be continued?
[comment]: # - Transfer: How did you transfer research results to:
[comment]: # - client and stakeholders at the end of the research (e.g. final meetings, reporting)
[comment]: # - the community, society, or specific target groups at the end of your research (e.g. your
[comment]: # research publication, at internal and external events, with community presentations)

This semester relied heavily on utilizing my research skills in different projects. For my projects: in-depth research,
personal project, and the group project, I have used the research strategies defined in the DOT Research Framework.
By incorporating these strategies into my research I was able to have a clear overview of my actions and I was able
to find a common ground while sharing feedback with my teachers and peers.

### In-depth research

The main research questions of my In-depth research was:
**How can LLVM compiler infrastructure be used to aid malware development?**, with the following sub-questions:

- Why would a malware developer choose an LLVM based language?
- Are plugin development results worth the time spent learning the LLVM infrastructure?
- How effective is the control flow flattening obfuscation?

I wanted to study the project's architecture and learn how to use it so that I could develop a plugin that would allow
me to customize the compilation process of LLVM-based languages. Therefore the first research question relied mainly
on the Library research by the means of Available Products Analysis, Literature Study and Design Patterns Research. With
that information I was able to gain understanding of the LLVM framework and move on.

The second and third question were based on developing plugins for the LLVM compiler. Therefore I had to use the Workshop
strategy to create a prototype and assess how much time and effort I have spent on the subject. Therefore, I have used
the Prototyping activity to create the plugins plugin and aided myself with knowledge from the Literature study. Then,
Then, I took my results and examined them with the Lab strategy, mainly using the Component and Usability testing
activities.

Throughout the whole research I have validated it using the Showroom strategy. I used Peer Reviews and presented my
project to my group mates and other students from the red teaming track to gain some valuable insights. Moreover, I
showed the project to my teachers during one on one talks using the Product Review strategy to get some information
from the experts in the domain (teachers).

### Personal project

### Group project

IT-Workz tasked us with conducting a study on how a penetration test can be provided as a service. They wanted us to
do some field work by performing a pentest at an external company and using the results as an input in our research.
Therefore, we have translated the stakeholders requirements into research questions and split them among our group.

The research question that I have chosen was: **What knowledge is required for different types of penetration testing?**.
To answer that, I needed to explain what is black, white and grey box testing. To do that, I needed to use the Library
research strategy, with the focus on the Literature Study. Penetration test at Hoefnagels was a very valuable input
to the research which lived in the the Field research strategy. Defining the scope with the company and determining
our responsibilities gave me insights on why would a company choose one of the approaches and what actual knowledge
is required.

We have validated our results using the Workshop research strategy by having meeting with our stakeholder and
showing them the progress of our research.

## Collaboration and communication

In my team I had two roles: a researcher and a Scrum master. Therefore I had two different goals: first, I was
responsible for the progress and quality of the results of my research. At the same time I was overseeing the
task and issue management in our team.

As the researcher, I was working with my group mates to reach our common goals, by means of helping each other
with the parts of the research that we struggled with, or by working together on the social engineering in the
Hoefnagels penetration test. Throughout the project, I have kept communication with other group members and
teachers about the research. Communication with clients happened after every sprint when we had a Teams meeting
to share our results and receive their feedback. While conducting the penetration test for Hoefnagels, we had
a couple of on-site meetings so that we could reach conclusions about the scope quicker and prepare for the
physical intrusion.

Moreover, I have attended the Hack of the Week events to listen to guest lectures or presentations prepared by
my peers. I believe that this was very important for me as for security professional, as I learned how security
related services are provided by different companies and I have analyzed their attitude towards clients.

### Writing skills

[comment]: # - What professional reporting did you do or contribute to? This can (and should) be internal
[comment]: # reporting in a project, reporting towards client / stakeholders in a project, or research
[comment]: # publications that you have written. Give a list of reporting that you have contributed to.
[comment]: # Indicate what parts are yours if you have worked in pairs or sub-teams.
[comment]: # - How did you guard the quality of your writing? Did you follow workshops, use online tips,
[comment]: # do reviews with others, ask for feedback, etc.?

### Presentation skills

[comment]: # - What presentations did you do or take part in? This can be presentations in sprint
[comment]: # evaluations, internal presentations within your team(s), presentations on the event of the
[comment]: # week, external presentations.
[comment]: # - How did you improve your presentation skills? Of course also here, practice makes
[comment]: # perfect, but what feedback did you get before or after your presentations, did you find tips
[comment]: # online, can you evaluate your presentation techniques?
