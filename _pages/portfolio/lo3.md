title: LO3 - The security professional
---

The goal of this learning outcome is to prove that I have worked on and improved my security specialist as well as
research and development skills. Moreover I have to show that I have applied aforementioned qualities in a professional
setting and were able to independently work on delivering good and valuable products.

## Research skills

This semester relied heavily on utilizing my research skills in different projects. For my projects: in-depth research,
personal project, and the group project, I have used the research strategies defined in the DOT Research Framework.
By incorporating these strategies into my research I was able to have a clear overview of my actions and I was able
to find a common ground while sharing feedback with my teachers and peers.

### In-depth research

The main research questions of my In-depth research was:
**How can LLVM compiler infrastructure be used to aid malware development?**, with the following sub-questions:

- Why would a malware developer choose an LLVM based language?
- Are plugin development results worth the time spent learning the LLVM infrastructure?
- How effective is the control flow flattening obfuscation?

I wanted to study the project's architecture and learn how to use it so that I could develop a plugin that would allow
me to customize the compilation process of LLVM-based languages. Therefore the first research question relied mainly
on the Library research by the means of Available Products Analysis, Literature Study and Design Patterns Research. With
that information I was able to gain understanding of the LLVM framework and move on.

The second and third question were based on developing plugins for the LLVM compiler. Therefore I had to use the Workshop
strategy to create a prototype and assess how much time and effort I have spent on the subject. Therefore, I have used
the Prototyping activity to create the plugins plugin and aided myself with knowledge from the Literature study. Then,
Then, I took my results and examined them with the Lab strategy, mainly using the Component and Usability testing
activities.

Throughout the whole research I have validated it using the Showroom strategy. I used Peer Reviews and presented my
project to my group mates and other students from the red teaming track to gain some valuable insights. Moreover, I
showed the project to my teachers during one on one talks using the Product Review strategy to get some information
from the experts in the domain (teachers).

### Personal project

In my personal project I decided to work on two aspects: security of BitTorrent protocol and learning the Go language.
I have structured my research in such a way so that I could investigate the protocol and use Go at the same time. Since
I had no previous experience with the language, it required carefully choosing the path in which I want to learn. The
main research questions were:

**How could the security of the BitTorrent protocol could be improved?**

- What are the main security concerns of the BitTorrent protocol?
- What risk is associated with using a distributed hash tables?
- How to address the lack of encryption in the protocol?

For the first two questions I have focused mainly on the Literature and Workshop strategies to get a better understanding
of the protocol and what security flaws it might bring. They have also served as an input for the third and last question.

I have relied on the Workshop and Lab strategies to learn and develop a solution which uses encryption that is compliant
with modern cryptographic standards. I believe that encryption in the protocol is a subject that should be finally addressed
and I might have made a step in the right direction with my project.

Moreover, I have validated my project with my peers and teachers. I had a personal project presentation in which I have shown
what I am working on and what are the goals that I want to achieve with this assignment. My peers and the teacher were curious
and gave me overall good feedback.

### Group project

IT-Workz tasked us with conducting a study on how a penetration test can be provided as a service. They wanted us to
do some field work by performing a pentest at an external company and using the results as an input in our research.
Therefore, we have translated the stakeholders requirements into research questions and split them among our group.

The research question that I have chosen was: **What knowledge is required for different types of penetration testing?**.
To answer that, I needed to explain what is black, white and grey box testing. To do that, I needed to use the Library
research strategy, with the focus on the Literature Study. Penetration test at Hoefnagels was a very valuable input
to the research which lived in the the Field research strategy. Defining the scope with the company and determining
our responsibilities gave me insights on why would a company choose one of the approaches and what actual knowledge
is required.

We have validated our results using the Workshop research strategy by having meeting with our stakeholder and
showing them the progress of our research.

## Collaboration and communication

In my team I had two roles: a researcher and a Scrum master. Therefore I had two different goals: first, I was
responsible for the progress and quality of the results of my research. At the same time I was overseeing the
task and issue management in our team.

As the researcher, I was working with my group mates to reach our common goals, by means of helping each other
with the parts of the research that we struggled with, or by working together on the social engineering in the
Hoefnagels penetration test. Throughout the project, I have kept communication with other group members and
teachers about the research. Communication with clients happened after every sprint when we had a Teams meeting
to share our results and receive their feedback. While conducting the penetration test for Hoefnagels, we had
a couple of on-site meetings so that we could reach conclusions about the scope quicker and prepare for the
physical intrusion.

Moreover, I have attended the Hack of the Week events to listen to guest lectures or presentations prepared by
my peers. I believe that this was very important for me as for security professional, as I learned how security
related services are provided by different companies and I have analyzed their attitude towards clients.

### Writing skills

This semester required a lot of writing from me. I chose to store all of my personal documentation on a website,
so that it would be easier to manage appendices and a lot of different categories of documents. On this site,
I have uploaded many write-ups and articles about all of my projects and activities like: personal project,
in-depth research, publication, redteaming handson experience and the portfolio. I think that majority of
these texts are good quality since I have gotten generally good fedback on them from my peers and teachers.

For the group project, I took part in writing all of the required documentation: research plan and document,
pentest reports, penetration testing guidelines as well as communicating with our clients. Our group has peer
reviewed each others work before considering document as done, and judging by my group's and client's feedback,
my writing and command of english was up to par. I am able to clearly present information and tailor it to the
target audience. This is proved by the fact that I have took part in two documents for IT-Workz: one for the
technical and other for the management personnel.

### Presentation skills

Presentations have always been a problem for me, but I think that in recent and especially in this semester
I have managed to get to a much better level than before. I became much calmer when speaking, and now I am able
to answer questions and give out additional information. Because of the amount of the communications with
our clients, I had to show our progress and goals in an easy to follow and understand way. I have presented
our progress both online and in person and in both cases, the audience was able to understand and follow the
topic.

However I still think there is room for improvement: when presenting my in-depth research for other red teaming
students, I got feedback from teachers. While it was quite positive, they said that I need to improve the structure
of my presentations, since sometimes it felt a bit chaotic. This is something that I have to pay more attention to,
as for me, it is easy to forget that somebody might not have the same knowledge on a certain topic as I do.

## Personal leadership

I chose this semester because of the freedom which cybersecurity field provides. Since I am
a software developer by trade, I was able to shape this semester so that I have spent a lot
of time on utilizing my skills on creating tools for red teaming purposes.

However, creating software was not the only thing I did - I had learned a lot about exploitation
on a level that I did not know I was able to. I learned how to evade antiviruses and static analysis or
I tried my luck with harder concepts like in-memory PowerShell script executions (unfortunately to no avail).

In my group project I was taking part in all of the group activities and remained proactive throughout. Starting
with communication with IT-Workz that required pushing them to keep contact with us, through being a Scrum master
and managing the team's effort to helping others and coming up with new ideas for penetration tests and other
technical activities.

For example during the phishing attack, I was brainstorming with Georgi Minchev to come up with the best possible
solutions to create the infrastructure for conducting the attack and to create a convicing email that could lure
the victims into entering our malicious website.

### Future orientation and ethics

Red teaming is on a thin line between doing good and actual harm. In this semester, I have spent a lot of time
writing tools for red teamers and open sourcing them, meaning that actual black hat hackers could use them as well.
However, I believe that this is necessary, since every new tool exposes a new vulnerability that should be looked
into, forcing software developers to make their code more secure and blue teamers to harden their infrastructure.

Our group project was all about investigating skills and resources required for pentesting by means of conducting
an actual security assessment and literature study. I think that the pentest conducted at Hoefnagels has shown
how easy it might be to break on premise of their company and do much harm. Moreover I believe that my input
in the phishing attack gave the company an idea on the weakness of the human link in even the most secure systems.

Overall, I think that I took ethics into consideraions during this semester whether I was developing
software for hacking or teaching other people how to conduct penetration tests.

## Evaluation and reflection

When reflecting on this semester I come to the conclusion that I have grown as a professional. By growth I mean
seeing and understanding my strenghts and weaknessess.

As for my strengths, I am able to work in a dynamic environment, with changing deadlines and requirements and still
be able to deliver quality products, just as I did for IT-Workz. I am very interested in how things work, so I will
always try to get to the bottom of things, whether it is an exploitation technique or a new technology. Moreover,
I am able to communicate with stakeholders so that they can understand what I am trying to convey.

Nevertheless, I believe that some things could always be improved. Sometimes I might become too invested into my own
projects, which makes me pay less attention to the group project. Moreover, because I am interested in understanding
how things work, it takes a lot of time for me to decide on what I should prioritize, just like the scopes of my
in-depth research and personal project.

All in all, I think that this semester taught me a lot. I have been engaged in professional communication on the level
I was not in previous semesters, so I had to level-up my soft skills. The research in this semester was also very extensive,
but I managed to succeed in almost everything, which means that my personal leadership, planning and motiviation skills
are on a very satisfactory level.
