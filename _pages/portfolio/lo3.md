title: LO3 - The security professional
---

[comment]: # LO3: the security professional
[comment]: # “The student shows to have practised and improved professional skills as a security specialist, and
[comment]: # as a researcher and developer.”
[comment]: # You are in your semester 6 or 7, so you must be able to learn and show professional skills on the
[comment]: # graduation level of our education, so on bachelor level. In general, that means that you can deliver
[comment]: # quality independently in an unpredictable and open setting. The professional skills you want to
[comment]: # show for are research skills, communication skills, personal leadership, and that you can manage
[comment]: # all aspects of carrying out an ICT project, in our case with some security context to it.

The goal of this learning outcome is to prove that I have worked on and improved my security specialist as well as
research and development skills. Moreover I have to show that I have applied aforementioned qualities in a professional
setting and were able to independently work on delivering good and valuable products.

## Research skills

[comment]: # - Where did you define and use a research approach? (group project, individual project,
[comment]: # professional application as a security specialist). For these projects explain:
[comment]: # - From your main question(s) and sub-questions how did you consider the different
[comment]: # research strategies? What strategies where used and why these?
[comment]: # - Triangulation and value:
[comment]: # - What were the research results from the combined research strategies?
[comment]: # - What was the value for the client of your R&D? What now does he have or know?
[comment]: # - How can and/or should this R&D be continued?
[comment]: # - Transfer: How did you transfer research results to:
[comment]: # - client and stakeholders at the end of the research (e.g. final meetings, reporting)
[comment]: # - the community, society, or specific target groups at the end of your research (e.g. your
[comment]: # research publication, at internal and external events, with community presentations)

This semester relied heavily on utilizing my research skills in different projects. For my projects: in-depth research,
personal project, and the group project, I have used the research strategies defined in the DOT Research Framework.
By incorporating these strategies into my research I was able to have a clear overview of my actions and I was able
to find a common ground while sharing feedback with my teachers and peers.

### In-depth research

The main research questions of my In-depth research was:
**How can LLVM compiler infrastructure be used to aid malware development?**, with the following sub-questions:

- Why would a malware developer choose an LLVM based language?
- Are plugin development results worth the time spent learning the LLVM infrastructure?
- How effective is the control flow flattening obfuscation?

I wanted to study the project's architecture and learn how to use it so that I could develop a plugin that would allow
me to customize the compilation process of LLVM-based languages. Therefore the first research question relied mainly
on the Library research by the means of Available Products Analysis, Literature Study and Design Patterns Research. With
that information I was able to gain understanding of the LLVM framework and move on.

The second and third question were based on developing plugins for the LLVM compiler. Therefore I had to use the Workshop
strategy to create a prototype and assess how much time and effort I have spent on the subject. Therefore, I have used
the Prototyping activity to create the plugins plugin and aided myself with knowledge from the Literature study. Then,
Then, I took my results and examined them with the Lab strategy, mainly using the Component and Usability testing
activities.

Throughout the whole research I have validated it using the Showroom strategy. I used Peer Reviews and presented my
project to my group mates and other students from the red teaming track to gain some valuable insights. Moreover, I
showed the project to my teachers during one on one talks using the Product Review strategy to get some information
from the experts in the domain (teachers).

### Personal project

### Group project

### Conclusions

## Collaboration and communication

[comment]: # From the roles you had in your projects:
[comment]: # - How did you collaborate in a team? what was your role(s) in a team?
[comment]: # - How did you communicate to stakeholders, experts, and others involved? Explain your
[comment]: # attitude and activities towards externals in meetings, sprint evaluations, organizing
[comment]: # activities and meetings, doing interviews, keeping contact.
[comment]: # - What events, workshops, etc. did you go to? What did you see, who did you meet?

### Writing skills

[comment]: # - What professional reporting did you do or contribute to? This can (and should) be internal
[comment]: # reporting in a project, reporting towards client / stakeholders in a project, or research
[comment]: # publications that you have written. Give a list of reporting that you have contributed to.
[comment]: # Indicate what parts are yours if you have worked in pairs or sub-teams.
[comment]: # - How did you guard the quality of your writing? Did you follow workshops, use online tips,
[comment]: # do reviews with others, ask for feedback, etc.?

### Presentation skills

[comment]: # - What presentations did you do or take part in? This can be presentations in sprint
[comment]: # evaluations, internal presentations within your team(s), presentations on the event of the
[comment]: # week, external presentations.
[comment]: # - How did you improve your presentation skills? Of course also here, practice makes
[comment]: # perfect, but what feedback did you get before or after your presentations, did you find tips
[comment]: # online, can you evaluate your presentation techniques?

## Personal leadership

[comment]: # - Explain what opportunities you saw and took in your learning this semester.
[comment]: # - How did you motivate yourself this semester?
[comment]: # - Did you motivate or help others? When, how?
[comment]: # - Can you give examples of where you took responsibility or where pro-active?

### Future orientation and ethics

[comment]: # Reflect on your project(s) in relation to society, sustainability, and ethics. Reconsider the
[comment]: # TICT analysis if you have done that in an early stage of your project.

## Evaluation and reflection

[comment]: # Considering the professional aspects mentioned:
[comment]: # - What are your strengths as a professional?
[comment]: # - What do you think are your limitations as a professional?
[comment]: # - How have you developed and grown as a professional?
