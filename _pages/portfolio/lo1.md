title: LO1 - The security specialist
---

## Definition

For the specialization of this course, I have chosen the red teamer track. I wanted to learn about the offensive perspective of cybersecurity as I feel,
that this is the best place for utilizing my skills from software development courses. Compared to the previous cybersecurity semester, this one gave me
a clearer overview of what is red teaming, what skills it needs and how it is used in modern companies.

### What is red teaming?

Red team means roughly a group that plays a role of an enemy to provide a security feedback from that side. The term was coined in the military, but now
is used in the cybersecurity world to denote a designated group of security specialists that are trying to breach security measures put up by the blue team
(system administrators and defensive security specialists). Major companies, such as Microsoft or FAANG, usually have a highly sophisticated red teaming
operations set up.

Typically, a red teaming operation will involve combining penetration testing techniques to try and detect any vulnerabilities that could grant them entrance
to the system or disclose sensitive information. These usually follow the Unified Kill Chain methodology for establishing the flow of the attack. Then, red
teamers usually refer to Mitre's ATT&CK framework to establish what hacking techniques might be most suitable for given reconnaissance, hacking or
post-exploitation phases. You can find more detailed description in my
[Trends Research](https://malpa222.github.io/portfolio/redt/trends#what-standards-and-methodologies-are-used-in-red-teaming-by-cybersecurity-companies).

While ransomware attacks are usually out of scope of red teaming operations, security specialists will often try to deliver malware loaders (described in
my [trends research](https://malpa222.github.io/portfolio/redt/trends#what-kind-of-malware-is-on-the-rise-right-now)) to the inside of the
system by the means of social engineering or exploiting other security holes. Apart from, software and people hacking, red teaming also includes assessing
the physical security of the company. It means that the red teamers will try to break into the building, or find pieces sensitive information left by
employees by accident.

### Why do companies need red teaming operations?

As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the red team operations usually combine multiple ethical hacking activities to achieve a bigger goal by gaining
a persistance in a system and then traversing and exploring the infrastructure under the radars of threat detection software. This presents a lot of
benefits for the company:

- Increased employee awareness

    Social engineering and physical security assessments usually result in increasing the employee awareness about what information are they sharing with
    outsiders and their trust levels. However, these exercises need to be performed periodically and on every levels of the hierarchy, as people tend to
    forget or not pay attention about the security of the company.

- Identifying parts of the infrastructure at risk

    By performing multiple ethical hacking techniques, red teamers are able to identify which areas of the system's infrastructure. While cooperating
    with the blue team, both groups can benefit by learning on each other's mistakes thus increasing the security of the system and the most
    sensitive parts.

Security professionals with red teaming knowledge are sought after by big companies. An employee with either software development skills (for creating custom
tooling), social engineering abilities (for hacking employees) and penetration testing knowledge for vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

## Hands-on learning

### In-depth research

### Phishing at Hoefnagels

### Exploitation techniques

## Professional application

I have applied the gained knowledge in the group project assignments that I have performed throughout the semester. The main goal of our group project was
to research how a pen test can be provided as a service. The company that created the assignment was IT-Workz. They wanted us to conduct a penetration test
with a fire safety company Hoefnagels. The assignment was not big enough to be called a red teaming operation, however the security assessment required
using the common techniques used by the red teamers. We have planned our work using the DOT Research Framework, which allowed us to plan how are we going
to approach the requirements presented by the stakeholders. You can find more details about our research in in my
[group project research description](https://malpa222.github.io/portfolio/group/description#research-questions).

### Hoefnagels

My role in this assignment was to conduct a social engineering test by creating a phishing campaign and sending it to the employees of Hoefnagels. I had to
learn how to find the vulnerable areas of the employee awareness. The goal of our social engineering operation was to find how to benefit the company with
our findings.

In the project I have learned how to use phishing software such as Beef-XSS, SocialPhish. Moreover we had to come up with solutions for bypassing the
search engine security measures as well as setting up a dns and a mail server to send the phishing messages to the employees of Hoefnagels. You can find
more information about it in my [Hoefnagels pen test write-up](https://malpa222.github.io/portfolio/group/phishing).

### Pentesting as a Service

However, the main goal of our project was to tell IT-Workz how a pentest could be provided as a service. Since they only knew computer security from the
defensive side, our group had to prepare them a set of guidelines, procedures, best practices and resources on both technical and high, business level. My
role in preparing the deliverables was explaining about different categories of pen tests and social engineering in both technical and management documents.

For the technical staff, I focused on explaining how to conduct white, black or gray box pentests, why they would choose one over another and what is the
output of such test. Moreover, I have also provided a list of resources and necessary tools. I did the same for social engineering. For the management level,
I tried explaining what is the business value of each type of pentest and social engineering, so that the management staff can understand what is the business
value of the activities. You can find more details in my group project description -
[pentesting as a service](http://localhost:4000/group/description#pentesting-as-a-service).

### Validation

### Individual project and in-depth research

### Group project

After initial contact with the stakeholders, we have translated their business requirements into a series of research questions and guidelines that
established the directions for our projects. As mentioned before, throughout the projects I have relied on the industry standards: Unified Kill Chain
and ATT&CK. Moreover, in the deliveries for the clients we have conducted risk analysis with the help of the CIA Matrix.

On every stage of the projects the results of our worked were validated with our teachers and project owners, so we could get immediate feedback and
apply it to the next phases of the research. When we have presented the results of our penetration test to the Hoefnagels management team, which
was was unaware of our project and received a very positive feedback. Moreover, we have presented our project to our peers, because the Hoefnagels
pentest required a physical intrusion activities. That was also valuable for our team since we got feedback from other students and teachers that
were not involved in our project.
