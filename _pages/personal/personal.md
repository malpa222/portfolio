## Introduction

The personal project in this specialisation is not strictly tied to our personal specialisation. Therefore, I have decided to put my efforts into learning about 
the Go programming language by researching the BitTorrent protocol.

Go is becoming an increasingly popular choice for backends and cloud environments. Developed at Google in 2007, Go was aimed to solve
some engineering problems that the company was facing back then. Since its inception, the language has proven to be fast, maintainable and easily scalable.

## Research questions

In order to structure the learning process, I have defined a the main research question that represents the goal of the project and a set of sub-questions
that are going to help me to achieve this goal.

**How could the security of the BitTorrent protocol could be improved with the Go programming language?**

- What are the main security concerns of the BitTorrent protocol?
- What is the risk associated with exploiting these vulnerabilities?
- How to address these security holes with Go?

## Research strategies

In order to compute an answer for the main research question, each sub-question needs to be researched. To do that I am going to use different research
strategies from the DOT framework.

**How could the security of the BitTorrent protocol could be improved with the Go programming language?**

- **What are the main security concerns of the BitTorrent protocol?**

  This question is focused on learning about the internals of the BitTorrent protocol. The protocol has been developed in 2001, but it lacks some of the features that
  are crucial for modern network infrastructures. I will approach this research question by applying the Library research to learn about the protocol. To get some
  hands-on experience, I will combine the Lab and the Workshop strategies by implementing the protocol in Golang. That way, it might be easier for me to visualize security holes. 

- **What is the risk associated with exploiting these vulnerabilities?**

  This is an extension of the previous question and aims to categorize and find the vulnerabilities with the biggest possible impact. I will do that
  by using the Workshop and Lab research strategy and trying to find an exploit to some of these vulnerabilities. Based on my findings I will categorize them by their 
  impact.

- **How these security holes should be addresed?**

  This sub-question focuses on trying to find a way how could Go be used to prevent some of these vulnerabilities. This question would require using the Library research
  for understanding how the found vulnerabilities should be fixed. The library research would also focus on learning the secure development guidelines and applying them
  to the Go programming language.
    
## Project management

In order to efficiently work on the project, I have decided to use Scrum framework for planning and management. I split the semester into three 3 week long sprints:

- Sprint 1 - 03.10 - 24.10
- Sprint 2 - 24.10 - 14.11
- Sprint 3 - 14.11 - 05.12
- Sprint 4 - 05.12 - 12.01.2023
