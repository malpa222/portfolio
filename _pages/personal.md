## Introduction

The personal project in this specialisation is not strictly tied to our personal specialisation. Therefore, I have decided to put my efforts into learning the
Go programming language.

Go is becoming an increasingly popular choice for backends and cloud environments. Developed at Google in 2007, Go was aimed to solve
some engineering problems that the company was facing back then. Since its inception, the language has proven to be fast, maintainable and easily scalable.

## Research questions

In order to structure the learning process, I have defined a the main research question that represents the goal of the project and a set of sub-questions
that are going to help me to achieve this goal.

**Is the Go programming language able to create a fast and secure library for the BitTorrent protocol?**

- What are the main use cases of Go?
- How does Go compare to other back-end programming languages, like PHP or Node.js?
- What are secure development guidelines for Go?
- How is Go handling E2E encryption?
