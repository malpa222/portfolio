## Introduction

The personal project in this specialisation is not strictly tied to our personal specialisation. Therefore, I have decided to put my efforts into learning the
Go programming language.

Go is becoming an increasingly popular choice for backends and cloud environments. Developed at Google in 2007, Go was aimed to solve
some engineering problems that the company was facing back then. Since its inception, the language has proven to be fast, maintainable and easily scalable.

## Research questions

In order to structure the learning process, I have defined a the main research question that represents the goal of the project and a set of sub-questions
that are going to help me to achieve this goal.

### Is the Go programming language able to create a fast and secure implementation of the BitTorrent protocol?

1. What are the main use cases of Go?
2. How does Go compare to other back-end programming languages, like PHP or Node.js?
3. What are secure development guidelines for Go?
4. How is Go handling E2E encryption? (?)

## Research strategies

In order to compute an answer for the main research question, each sub-question needs to be researched. To do that I am going to use different research
strategies from the DOT framework.

### What are the main use cases of Go?

This question requires studying the history and intentions behind the language, as well as study cases of companies that have used Go. This will require mainly
library research strategy.

### How does Go compare to other back-end programming languages, like PHP or Node.js?

This subject needs hands-on testing and experiments to measure speed of the language while trying to solve the same problem. Moreover, some research on how
Go works internally could be helpful while trying to solve this question. Therefore, this question will mainly require Lab research strategy with a little bit
of Library.

### What are secure development guidelines for Go?

This section will require building on top of the knowledge gained from the two previous questions: the main use cases of Go and how the language works internally.
This will lead me to conclusions how a secure development workflow should look like in Go which I will then compare with the ones recommended by the language
developers. This will mostly rely on the Library research, Lab and Field to get opinions from Go developers.
