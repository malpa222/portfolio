This document is a follow-up on the trends research, precisely on the topic of cross-platform malware. Since virtually everybody in the western world owns a smartphone
or a personal computer, the amount of different platforms that are running on our hardware is bigger than it ever was. This forces malware developers to spend much more
time on creating malware for each of these systems.

Nowadays, with the rise of new systems programming languages such as Rust or Go, developing malicious software for different platforms has become more accessible
and much quicker than it ever was.

## Research questions

Because portable software is a broad subject, I have decided to only focus on some key parts of the domain. My research will try to answer the following question,
along with the sub-questions:

**Is Rust a good choice for creating a cross-platform malware?**

- Is Rust well supported on Windows/Linux/MacOS?
- How long does it takes to develop a malware in Rust?
- How does Rust handle binary portability/cross-platform compiling?

I will try to answer the main research question by working on each of the sub-questions and producing a multiplatform keylogger written in Rust.

## Is Rust well supported on Windows/Linux/MacOS?

## How long does it takes to develop a malware in Rust?

## How does Rust handle binary portability/cross-platform compiling?
