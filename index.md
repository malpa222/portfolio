## Introduction

I am starting this minor having completed the cybersecurity specialisation in semester 4. I was able to gain small experience in
security related topics such as networking, pentesting, reverse engineering, risk analysis and Linux administration.

During that semester, my personal project was focused on the subject of buffer overflows and reverse engineering. My goal was to research
how buffer overflows can happen and perform a vulnerability analysis by a researching stack smashing vulnerability in a TP-Link router.  
The group project was a comprehensive security assesment, with red and blue team activities. We conducted the assesment in a Tilburg-based
company and gave them recommendations for hardening their infrastuscture.

### My interests

Since the beginning of the study, I became interested in Linux system management. Since then I spent a lot of time trying out different
distributions, tailoring them to fit my needs or automating/extending the core functionality by utilising scripting languages such as Bash,
Python or Lua.

The thing I enjoyed the most in the previous semester was my personal project - I was conducting vulnerability analysis on a fairly low 
level. I had to understand and learn how processors work and process bits and bytes. Then, trying to exploit the vulnerability was quite
a hard task - I could not analise the firmware, as the binary file was scrambled.

Moreover, I am interested in the idea of a decentralised infrastructures. Contrary to the conservative and prevalent client - server 
infrastructures, the decentralised networks can be naturally scalable if well designed. Furthermore, decentralised networks can be 
built on top of secure protocols or data structures (such as blockchain), which enhance the security of the network.

### Goals for this semester

Based on my previous experiences and interests, I plan to further improve my red-teaming skills. Coming from a software background,
using my programming skills to develeop my toolbox or to exploit weaknesess of computers seems the most appealing to me. I might not be 
yet deciced on my individual project, but I am sure that I would like to follow the direction of distributed networks.
